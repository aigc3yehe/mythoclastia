    * üé® `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
    * ‚ö°Ô∏è `:zap:` when improving performance
    * üî• `:fire:` when removing code or files
    * üêõ `:bug:` when fixing a bug

All JavaScript code is linted with ESLint and should adhere to the project's ESLint configuration.

* Prefer the object spread operator (`{...anotherObj}`) to `Object.assign()`
* Use camelCase for variables, properties and function names
* Use PascalCase for classes and React components
* Use the arrow function syntax for anonymous functions
